## Project Layout

-   [Decomission scrips](./decom) - Used to remove configs of services that may not be needed anymore and moves them to the [backup](../backup) folder.
-   [replaceGradleUpgradeMakefiles.py](replaceGradleUpgradeMakefiles.py) - Used to make replacements in files. For example, optimization of certain scripts spread out through all projects.

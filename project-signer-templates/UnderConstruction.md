# Under Construction Document

Under construction means that the project is not complete. This means that the project is not ready under any means to be checked, consulted or studied.

This status means in other words that:

-   No conclusion should be made about the project.
-   The project will change very often.
-   Code coverage may or may not be a goal of the project
-   There are no written articles about it yet.
-   There could be code drafts on it that just don't work yet.
-   The only possible goal yet is just to consult and follow changes.

The reason behind this document is to clearly inform about the meaning of being under construction.
